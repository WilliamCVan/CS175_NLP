hey junichi 
i couldnt tell you how to source a story from swaziland 
hello teddy 
please forgive me 
do we have the president 
thats good well if you need anything just let me know okay 
are you stupid 
sorry teddy but its true thats ok 
we dont have time for questions 
but it wasnt necessary 
another example is slash 
this is too much 
it goes hand in hand with doubt 
he even has me trembling now 
you know everybody telling me what i saw wasnt real 
my dream of becoming the king of this nation 
thus when you see the work 
at a school in brooklyn new york 
you can see the relationships between the different names themselves 
right into the camera 
he was alive 
him remember 
its just a little bit of fluffy stuff its not a big deal 
now you know how i felt 
what are you doing  
donald said hed worked with a scientist from boston but the scientist had been captured 
so you became a beauty artist 
to read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing 
the real issue in cellular biology 
pardon 
why wont you see me 
breathing shakily  do you understand me
