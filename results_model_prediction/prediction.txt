hey junichi 
i couldnt tell you how to source a story from swaziland 
hello teddy 
will you be too late 
do we have the president 
i told you that youd be fine 
are you stupid 
sorry teddy but its true thats ok 
we dont have time for this 
but it wasnt necessary 
another example is slash 
this is too smart 
it goes hand in hand with doubt 
he even has me trembling now 
you said everybody telling me what you saw 
my dream of becoming the king of this nation 
thus when you see the work 
at a school in brooklyn new york 
you can see the relationships between the different names 
right into the camera 
he was alive 
him remember 
its just a little bit of fluffy stuff its not a big deal 
now i understand that you should be me 
what do you want 
donald said hed worked with a scientist from boston but the scientist had been captured 
so you became a beauty artist 
to read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing 
the real issue in cellular biology 
pardon 
why wont you see me 
yeah right
